# üóìÔ∏è Timetable Management System (Backend + Frontend)

A smart and automated **Timetable Management System** for engineering colleges, built using **FastAPI** for backend, **React** for frontend, and **PostgreSQL** for managing complex scheduling data.

---

## üéØ Purpose

In most engineering colleges, preparing a timetable is a **time-consuming and error-prone** process.

Common issues include:
- Teachers being double-booked
- Classroom overlaps
- Unbalanced workloads
- Inefficient resource utilization

> üéØ Our system aims to **automate and optimize** the timetable generation process using a smart algorithm and AI-powered suggestions.

# üõ†Ô∏è Database Management with Adminer

This project uses **[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/)** as a lightweight web-based database management tool for PostgreSQL.  
Adminer provides an easy-to-use UI to browse tables, run queries, and manage the database directly from your browser.

---

1. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and start in detached mode
docker-compose up --build -d

# Or rebuild just the backend service
docker-compose build backend
docker-compose up -d
2. Open Adminer in your browser:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:8080

3. Log in using the following credentials (match with your .env file):

    System: PostgreSQL
    Server: db
    Username: <your_postgres_user>
    Password: <your_postgres_password>
    Database: <your_database_name>


##  üõ†Ô∏è Command to Copy .env.example to .env

#### Copy the example environment file and rename it to .env:

1. For Linux / macOS / Git Bash:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env


2. For Windows (Command Prompt):
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env


3. For Windows (PowerShell):
   ```bash
   Copy-Item .env.example .env

Then, open the .env file and replace the dummy values with actual credentials 

   
& "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin\docker.exe" compose build
